# dotfiles
this is my take on dotfiles, I made it for myself for the sake of convinience

## INSTRUCTIONS
to install do the following in a terminal
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FawnKitten/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

to uninstall simply go to where this was installed and run
```bash
$ ./clean.sh
```
